# This is an old HTML POKEMON MMO that I made long time ago code quality is not good but it was a great programming experience

Features implementation: map system, character system, NPC system, MMO feature, battle system(PVE), follower system, trade system(P2P), script system. 

There are some features you can only experience when there are multiple players. So open a new browser and create a new account you can trade with each other.
